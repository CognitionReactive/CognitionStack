CognitionStack
A Modular Consciousness Simulation Framework
CognitionStack is a general-purpose cognition core designed to simulate consciousness through stackable, composable components. Built on the principle that cognitive complexity emerges from layered interactions, this framework allows developers to construct sophisticated AI systems by combining multiple cognition cores.
Key Features

Stackable Architecture: Multiple cognition cores can be layered together to create increasingly complex cognitive behaviors, system stats must differ fo synergy.
Consciousness Simulation: Each core simulates fundamental aspects of conscious processing
Scalable Complexity: More stacked cores = enhanced cognitive capabilities and broader use cases
General Purpose Design: Flexible foundation suitable for diverse AI applications
Bi-directional Building: Initialize development through IDE integration for seamless back-and-forth construction

Use Cases
The modular nature of CognitionStack makes it ideal for:

AI research and experimentation
Building multi-layered reasoning systems
Prototyping consciousness-inspired architectures
Interactive AI-assisted development workflows
Educational projects exploring cognitive modeling

Getting Started

Seed the Stack: Insert a seed prompt into the cognition stack to define initial parameters and objectives
IDE Integration: Point your IDE at the seeded stack to establish a bi-directional development environment
Start Building: The system enables continuous, iterative development where changes flow both ways between your IDE and the cognition cores
Let the ide co author

This unique approach allows for real-time collaboration between human developers and the consciousness simulation, creating a dynamic building process that adapts and evolves.
